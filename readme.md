Project Overview
This project is a web-based game or application built primarily in JavaScript. It has both server-side and client-side components, structured to deliver interactive experiences directly in the browser. The backend.js file contains server-side functionality, while the public directory houses all frontend resources, including HTML, JavaScript, and images.

Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Node.js installed, as this project requires Node for managing dependencies and running the server.

Installation and Setup:
1) Extract the Zip File: Unzip the contents to a directory of your choice.
2) Install Dependencies:

   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   Run the following command to install dependencies:
in command prompt
npm install
This command reads from package.json and installs all necessary modules listed there.
3) Start the Server:

To launch the server, run:
in command prompt
node backend.js
This will start the server on the specified port (check backend.js for the exact port number if needed).
4) Access the Application:
Open the public/index.html file in a web browser to start the application frontend.


File Structure and Descriptions
Here’s a breakdown of each file and directory:

Root Directory:
package.json: A JSON file defining project metadata, including name, version, and dependencies. It also specifies scripts for running or building the project if configured.
package-lock.json: This file locks the exact versions of installed dependencies to ensure consistent installs across environments.
backend.js: A Node.js file that likely contains server-side logic for the application. This may handle data, routing, or real-time functionality (e.g., WebSocket connections if it’s an interactive game).

Public Directory (Frontend Resources):
The public directory contains all resources for the frontend, which the browser will use to render the game or app.
public/index.html: The main HTML file that structures the webpage. It loads necessary scripts, styles, and assets to display the frontend of the application.
public/img/: Contains image assets used in the game or application UI.
webb-dark.png: An image file that may be used for background, branding, or specific game visuals.
public/js/: This directory holds all JavaScript files required for the frontend.
public/js/classes/: Contains JavaScript classes for the game’s core functionality.
Player.js: Defines a Player class, likely handling player-specific attributes (e.g., position, movement, health) and methods for interactions within the game.
Projectile.js: Defines a Projectile class, likely representing objects that the player or enemies can launch (e.g., bullets, arrows). This file probably includes attributes like speed, direction, and impact effects.
eventListeners.js: A JavaScript file that sets up event listeners (e.g., for keyboard or mouse inputs). This enables player interaction by triggering functions in response to actions like pressing keys or clicking the mouse.
frontend.js: The primary frontend JavaScript file that brings together different components. It may initialize the game, render the interface, and update game states continuously.

Running the Project Locally:
After completing the setup steps, ensure the server (backend) is running by confirming the backend.js script is active.
Access index.html through a browser. If any issues arise, check the console for errors, as the browser’s developer tools may offer insights into potential issues (e.g., missing files or syntax errors).

Notes
Modifying Assets: To add or change images, place them in the public/img/ directory. Update any references to these files in the HTML or JavaScript files as needed.
Game Mechanics: To adjust game mechanics, modify values in Player.js, Projectile.js, or other JavaScript files under public/js/classes/.
